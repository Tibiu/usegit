# Suggestion: Introducing `git stash` Command

## Why Use  `git stash`?

The `git stash`command allows developers to temporarily save and store their uncommitted changes in a "stash." This is particularly useful when working on a task and needing to switch to a different branch or context without committing incomplete changes. The stash can later be applied to the working directory, effectively allowing developers to switch between tasks more smoothly.

### Benefits

- **Context Switching**: Easily save changes and switch tasks without committing unfinished work.
- **Code Isolation**: Isolate ongoing changes when critical tasks or bugs need immediate attention.
- **Reducing Unwanted Commits**: Temporarily set aside unnecessary changes that shouldn't be part of the current commit.
- **Maintaining Clean History**: Keep the commit history clean by using git stash for temporary changes, ensuring only completed and tested changes are committed.

### Practical Example

Save your ongoing changes to a stash
```bash
git stash
```
Switch to a different branch or task
```bash
git checkout <other-branch>
```
Work on the new task.
Return to your original branch and apply the stash
```bash
git checkout <original-branch>
git stash apply
```
